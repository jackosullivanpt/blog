	    <p> My aim is to help people live healthier happier lives.  I believe that all we need to do is to sleep well, breathe well, 
		  move well then move often, eat well with good friends and family, listen to good music and drink good wine, 
		  well, because there are plenty of studies that say that wine is good for you and life is to short not to enjoy yourself.  
		  </p>
<br>
	  <p> I will show you how you can enjoy wine whilst also keeping fit and burning calories to get your desired body. 
		  It will require hard work like with anything that's worthwhile in life but with my healthy lifestyle system and 
		  coaching I will show you the step by step approach to leading a healthy and happy life. </p>
<br>
	<p> I also believe that everyone has the right to wake up every morning happy with what they will be doing on that day. 
		My mission is to inspire and help people live a healthy, happy and fulfilled life with no prolonged stress,
		by training and improving the mind, body and spirit.</p>
<br>
	    <p>I am passionate about helping and improving peoples lives and I am dedicating my career to doing that.  </p>
<br>	    
	    <p>I am a normal guy that has found it hard in the past to consistently train, eat well and lead a healthy lifetyle. So I
		    developed a unique healthy lifestyle system that allowed me to be more consistent and therefore get better results 
	    	    from my training program. I feel happier in myself for being more consistent and seeing some great results in all 
		    aspects of my life as well as the body. </p>
<br>	    
	    <p>The system focuses on all the areas of fitness and wellbeing to create a healthy mind and body</p>
<br>		    
	    <p> As well as the healthy lifestyle system I have also designed a unique core rebuilding system. I suffered from having 
		    back pain, for some years which was caused from sitting for too long and not knowing how to brace my core or move
		    properly when lifting objects in the gym or during everyday activities. After a lot of research and core rebuilding 
		    exercises I managed to fix my back pain. I learned how to move better and developed a really strong core from the 
		    foundations. I have 10 stages to my core development system, to build a strong and functional core.</p>
<br>    
	<p>This is a new age of training and I want to welcome you to it. </p>
<br>	    
	    
	    <p>One Love,</p>
