	<p>
	Are you fed up of the Rat Race! Do you think you have got what it take sto be a Modern Primal Warrior? 
	    </p>

	Push yourself outside your comfort zone, build your self-esteem and confidence and become satisfied 
	    that you have achieved something great.

	<p>
	Get over your fears - Fear is false evidence appearing real! It's an illusion. Be FEARLESS! 
	    </p>
	    
	<p>
	Turn off the TV. Don't be a spectator anymore, get out into the field where the action is. Release raw intense 
	    energy and release stress and frustration.

		  drink good wine and listen to good music. This is my odyssey
