	<p>
	Get over your fears - Fear is false evidence appearing real! It's an illusion. Be FEARLESS! 
	    </p>
	    <br>
	    
	<p>
	Turn off the TV. Don't be a spectator anymore, get out into the field where the action is. Release raw intense 
	    energy, stress and frustration.

		 training zone and motivate you if you start to slow down. This will help to get the best out of you, to 
		 increase your fitness and burn as many calories as possible.</p>
	 <br>   
	    
	  <p>You will receive a free report of your performance emailed to you after the session has finished.</p>

	 <p> My aim is to help people live healthier happier lives.  I believe that all we need to do is to sleep well, breathe well, 
		  move well then move often, eat well with good friends and family, listen to good music and drink good wine, 
		  well, because there are plenty of studies that say that wine is good for you and life is to short not to enjoy yourself.  
		  </p>
	  <p> I will show you how you can enjoy wine whilst also keeping fit and burning calories to get your desired body. 
		  It will require hard work like with anything that's worthwhile in life but with my healthy lifestyle system and 
		  coaching I will show you the step by step approach to leading a healthy and happy life. 
	<p>One love, </p>
