<p> Growing up I was always extremely skinny and weak. One of the kids that would get blown over by the wind on a gusty day. It was through thought of my own for me being this way, I was extremely active as a child which is a great thing, but I wouldn’t eat properly which wasn’t a good thing. </p>
<p>I would run home from school and get changed just to go out and play football with all my friends, we would play until it got dark and often not eat too much. Mum would go mad that she had cooked a big dinner but I wasn’t interested in eating it. 
What also didn’t help was the crappy articles written by people who didn’t know their ass form a hole in the ground (and me being extremely naïve, followed their advice. Big lesson learnt always check the background of the person writing the article. Anyone can write stuff online, always check their sources and previous articles, it’s easy to spot a phoney), telling everyone to eat less to get leaner and slimmer but also bigger!! WTF!</p>
<p>If only I knew then what I know now aye! </p>
<p>My goal by sharing this information is to help not make the same mistakes as I did. To give them sound advice which will actually benefit them and their life goals. </p>
<p>So follow me on my journey and if you have any questions that you would like answered, send an email to info@jackosullivanpt.co.uk.</p>

<p>Committed to your success,</p>
