Whoah! Okay, soo... I have managed to completely change the site, probably not the best idea given my knowledge of creating websites but i have done it any way.

For practice I am going to create a couple of blog posts and to kill two birds with one stone, I am going to keep a reference of all the editing that I have done so far.

Unfortunately I have only just come up with this genius idea and I am about finished with deleting what I think is useless content, I may well be wrong!!!
