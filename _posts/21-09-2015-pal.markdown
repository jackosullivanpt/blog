As humans we require a certain amount of energy to function properly, without any movement. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the basic amount of energy your body needs at rest.

There are many different factors that can affect you BMR including height, weight, gender, age, diet and genetics, weight, body fat percentage, body temperature, external temperature and exercise. Body composition is one of the main factors - even at rest a muscle cells are metabolically more active than fat cells.
You can calculate your BMR by using the Schofield Calculation; it is one of the most widely used calculation and allows you to see how many calories your are burning at rest. A very useful tool if your looking to lose weight, gain weight and even if your looking to maintain your current bodyweight.
Below is a simple calculation you can use to work out your BMR.
The Schofield Calculation

Men:
10 - 17 years     BMR = 17.7 x W + 657        SEE = 105
18 - 29 years     BMR = 15.1 x W + 692        SEE = 156
30 - 59 years     BMR = 11.5 x W + 873        SEE = 167

Women:
10 - 17 years     BMR = 13.4 x W + 692        SEE = 112
18 - 29 years     BMR = 14.8 x W + 487        SEE = 120
30 - 59 years     BMR = 8.3 x W + 846          SEE = 112

W = Bodyweight in kg
SEE = Standard error of estimation

PAL factor
To make our BMR more accurate we must factor in how active we are.

Sedentary (little or no exercise) = BMR x 1.2
Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) = BMR x 1.4
Moderatetely active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) = BMR x 1.55
Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) = BMR x 1.75
Extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) = BMR x 1.9

How can this help you?
By knowing your BMR you know how many calories your body needs to maintain its basic functions and adding in the PAL factor you can work out excatly how many calories your body burns each day. 
Once we know this its easier to lose weight - eat enough calories to cover your BMR and add exercise to create a calorie deficit.
To maintain your body weight eat about the same amount of calories as your BMR total.
To increase lean mass eat slightly more calories than your BMR.
Remember it is important to include the PAL factor and be honest with yourself when it comes to how active you are.
You may need to slightly adjust calories up or down until you are on track towards your goals.
Please do not dramatically increase or decrease calorie consumption as this can lead to rapid weight gain or weight loss. It is not healthly to do this so im not advising it. Easy does it now, you will benefit greater from a slighter increase or decrease in calories. I will be writing posts on 'crash diets' and 'yo-yo dieting' within the next few weeks.

I hope this helps you towards your goals.
