  <p>To provide fitness programs in schools and colleges. 
  Our goal isnâ€™t just to fight against obesity, it is to improve a child's physical and mental health, 
  and improve their test results so that they get an overall better chance to succeed in life. 
</p>
<br>

<p> To encourage children to get outdoors and play outside more often while educating them about the environment
  and how their actions now can benefit the planet in the future and create a better environment for their children. 
</p>
<br>

  <p>To provide safer parks and open spaces for children to play in.

  <p>
  With an abundance of sporting talent in the UK, it would be a dream of mine to set up a 
  Youth Athlete Development Program through the move around project. </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  This will allow young people to get the correct training and guidance to become the best athletes that they can be.
