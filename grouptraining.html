      <h2 class="panel-title">How do we do this?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    <p>We offer a <b> Constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movement workout.</b></p>
    <p><b>CONSTANTLY VARIED</b> — Many people head to the gym and go through the same workout without ever changing what they do.
      Whereas in our training sessions we are always changing the workouts, never letting your body adapt.
      This is why everyone who joins the group training team are always getting great results. Your body never gets used to
      anything so you never reach those plateaus.</p>

    <p><b>HIGH INTENSITY</b> — Many people think intensity is screaming and yelling and looking like you are going to pop a vain in your neck.
      This is not intensity, although it may sometimes be the result of intensity. Intensity is the act of creating power
      (power = force multiplied by distance divided by time). In basic English we are saying power/intensity is how much weight
      you can move over the longest distance in the shortest amount of time. Our goal is to create people who can run further,
      move more weight, do more push-ups, flip a tire faster, all while of course maintaining proper form and technique.</p>

    <p><b>FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS</b> — These movements are what human beings were built for. Movements that are natural and safe.
      Movements we use in everyday life such as squatting, deadlifting, pulling yourself up, etc.
      This is NOT standing on a Bosu ball on one leg doing bicep curls. This is NOT sitting in a machine that holds you in place
      while you execute a movement that isolates one muscle leaving your body unbalanced with useless strength.
      These are movements that promote neurological and hormonal responses, leading to better health, actual strength,
      actual core stability, agility, and mobility.</p>
